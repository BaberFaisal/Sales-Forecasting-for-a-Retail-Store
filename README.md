#  Sales Forecasting for a Retail Store

This project demonstrates an end-to-end time series forecasting pipeline for retail sales. It includes **data generation, exploration, feature engineering, SARIMA modeling, evaluation**, and **forecasting future sales**. The notebook simulates realistic sales trends and builds a robust statistical model for forecasting.

##  Project Overview

The goal of this notebook is to simulate and model retail sales data to forecast future sales using the SARIMA model. The process mimics a real-world scenario where sales data is impacted by trends, seasonality, promotions, and holidays.

---

##  Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used:

- `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
- `statsmodels` – Time series modeling (SARIMA, ADF Test, Decomposition)
- `sklearn` – Evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
- `warnings` – Ignore unnecessary output

---

##  Data Generation

Synthetic monthly sales data was generated to reflect:

-  **Trend**: Slight upward growth over time  
-  **Seasonality**: Higher sales in Q4 (holiday season), dip in Q1  
-  **Random noise**: Variability to simulate real sales  
-  **Promotional activity**: Random binary flag to simulate marketing  
-  **Holiday effect**: December marked as a holiday month  

This approach ensures the dataset resembles real-world retail behavior for testing time series models.

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key exploratory steps:

-  Convert date column to datetime and set as index  
-  Checked for missing values  
-  Plotted sales over time to observe trends and fluctuations  
-  Seasonal decomposition (additive model) to separate trend, seasonal, and residual components  
-  ACF and PACF plots to detect lags and seasonality  

---

##  Stationarity and Decomposition

To ensure model validity:

-  **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test** was used to check for stationarity  
-  Differencing applied if non-stationary  
-  ACF and PACF plots helped select SARIMA parameters: (p, d, q)(P, D, Q, s)

This step ensures SARIMA assumptions are satisfied.

---

##  Feature Engineering

Although SARIMA is univariate, some features were engineered to extend possibilities:

-  **Lag Features**: Previous month's sales  
-  **Rolling Mean**: Optional for smoothing trends  
-  Rows with missing values from lags/rolling were dropped  

These features allow for future transition to supervised models or SARIMAX.

---

##  Modeling with SARIMA

SARIMA was chosen for its ability to model both seasonal and trend components.

Steps:

-  Split data into training and validation (last 6 months used for validation)  
-  Conducted grid search over selected (p, d, q)(P, D, Q, s) combinations  
-  Best model selected using evaluation metrics  
-  Forecast made on validation set  

---

##  Model Evaluation

Model evaluated using:

-  **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
-  **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
-  **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**  

These metrics ensured that forecast accuracy was measurable and interpretable.

---

##  Forecasting Future Sales

Final steps:

-  Best SARIMA model retrained on full historical data  
-  Forecast made for **next 6 months**  
-  Confidence intervals generated to quantify uncertainty  

These forecasts are valuable for inventory planning, budgeting, and promotions.

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a full simulation-to-forecast pipeline for time series modeling using SARIMA. Key takeaways:

- Generated realistic synthetic data  
- Performed robust EDA and decomposition  
- Validated stationarity with ADF  
- Tuned and evaluated SARIMA model  
- Forecasted future sales with confidence intervals

##  Future Improvements

- Use **real-world retail datasets** for production-ready insights  
- Include exogenous features (SARIMAX), such as weather, marketing spend  
  Compare with machine learning and deep learning models (XGBoost, LSTM)  
- Automate hyperparameter search across larger ranges
